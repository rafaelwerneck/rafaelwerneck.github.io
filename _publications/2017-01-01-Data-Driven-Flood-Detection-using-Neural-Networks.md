This paper describes the approaches used by our team (MultiBrasil) for the Multimedia Satellite Task at MediaEval 2017. For both disaster image retrieval and flood-detection in satellite images, we employ neural networks for end-to-end learning. Specifically, for the first subtask, we exploit Convolutional Networks and Relation Networks while, for the latter, dilated Convolutional Networks were employed.
