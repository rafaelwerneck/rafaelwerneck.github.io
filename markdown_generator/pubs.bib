  abstract = {This paper introduces the Bag of Graphs (BoG), a Bag-of-Words model
	that encodes in graphs the local structures of a digital object.
	We present a formal definition, introducing concepts and rules that
	make this model flexible and adaptable for different applications.
	We define two BoG-based methods -- Bag of Singleton Graphs (BoSG)
	and Bag of Visual Graphs (BoVG), which create vector representations
	for graphs and images, respectively. We evaluate the Bag of Singleton
	Graphs (BoSG) for graph classification on four datasets of the IAM
	repository, obtaining significant results in accuracy and execution
	time. The method Bag of Visual Graphs (BoVG) is evaluated for image
	classification on Caltech and ALOI datasets, and for remote sensing
	image classification on images of Monte Santo and Campinas datasets.
	This framework opens possibilities for retrieval, classification,
	and clustering tasks on large datasets that use graph-based representations
	impractical before due to the complexity of inexact graph matching.},

    abstract="In this paper, we propose a novel multiclass classifier for the open-set recognition scenario. This scenario is the one in which there are no a priori training samples for some classes that might appear during testing. Usually, many applications are inherently open set. Consequently, successful closed-set solutions in the literature are not always suitable for real-world recognition problems. The proposed open-set classifier extends upon the Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classifier. Nearest neighbors are simple, parameter independent, multiclass, and widely used for closed-set problems. The proposed Open-Set NN (OSNN) method incorporates the ability of recognizing samples belonging to classes that are unknown at training time, being suitable for open-set recognition. In addition, we explore evaluation measures for open-set problems, properly measuring the resilience of methods to unknown classes during testing. For validation, we consider large freely-available benchmarks with different open-set recognition regimes and demonstrate that the proposed OSNN significantly outperforms their counterparts in the literature."

  abstract = {A pet that goes missing is among many people's worst fears: a moment of distraction is enough for a dog or a cat wandering off from home. Some measures help matching lost animals to their owners; but automated visual recognition is one that --- although convenient, highly available, and low-cost --- is surprisingly overlooked. In this paper, we inaugurate that promising avenue by pursuing face recognition for dogs. We contrast four ready-to-use human facial recognizers (EigenFaces, FisherFaces, LBPH, and a Sparse method) to two original solutions based upon convolutional neural networks: BARK (inspired in architecture-optimized networks employed for human facial recognition) and WOOF (based upon off-the-shelf OverFeat features). Human facial recognizers perform poorly for dogs (up to 60.5 {\%} accuracy), showing that dog facial recognition is not a trivial extension of human facial recognition. The convolutional network solutions work much better, with BARK attaining up to 81.1 {\%} accuracy, and WOOF, 89.4 {\%}. The tests were conducted in two datasets: Flickr-dog, with 42 dogs of two breeds (pugs and huskies); and Snoopybook, with 18 mongrel dogs.},

These cost functions are embedded into a graph matching-based classifier. The learning algorithm is based on an open-set recognition approach. An open-set recognition describes a problem formulation in which the training process does not have access to labeled samples of all classes that may show up during the test phase. We also investigate a set of measures to characterize local graph properties. Performed experiments considering widely used datasets demonstrate that our solution leads to better or comparable results to those observed for several state-of-the-art baselines."

    abstract = {Detecting anomalies in time series data of hydrocarbon reservoir production is crucially important. Anomalies can result for different reasons: gross errors, system availability, human intervention, or abrupt changes in the series. They must be identified due to their potential to alter the series correlation, influence data-driven forecast, and affect classification results. We have developed a visual analytics approach based on an interactive visualization of time series data involving machine learning approaches for anomaly identification. Our methods rely upon a z-score normalization technique along with isolation forests. The methods leverage the prior probability of anomalies from a time-window, do not require labeled training data with normal and abnormal conditions, and incorporate specialist knowledge in the exploration process. We apply, evaluate, and discuss the methods’ capability using a benchmark data set (UNISIM–II–M-CO) and real field data in three visual exploration setups. The ground-truth annotations were done by human specialists and considered different interventions in the reservoir. Our methods detect approximately 95\% of the human intervention anomalies, and about 82\%–89\% detection rate for other anomalies identified during data exploration.}

A throughout literature review (considering the machine-learning technique, number of classes, rock types, and image types) presents a diversity of datasets employed and a wide range of classification results as well as multiple problem formulations. Throughout the discussion of the literature, we highlight some common machine-learning pitfalls and criticize the decisions taken by some authors on the problem formulation. We present an experimental contribution by evaluating the classification of seven types of rocks found in carbonate reservoirs along with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures available through a well-known open-source library. For this experimentation, we detail the preparation of the dataset of drill core plugs (DCPs), the experimental setup itself, and the obtained results considering the normalized accuracy and the traditional accuracy as metrics. We performed the manual background segmentation of the employed dataset of DCPs; so the results reported are not influenced by the background of the images. We evaluate top-1, top-2, and top-3 performance for the problem. We apply fusion of multiple CNNs for richer classification decisions. We also contribute by presenting the manual classification — human labeling by looking at the image on the computer screen — of the same seven-class dataset, performed by six non-geologist volunteers. Finally, we present a conclusion for the results obtained with our experiments and share valuable advice for researchers applying machine learning to rock classification.}

    abstract = {Forecasting in the energy sector is critical for planning and efficiency, but existing methods require extensive historical data and struggle with changing conditions. This work presents a few-shot forecasting method for energy time series prediction under nonstationary conditions and data scarcity. The solution “plugs into” any existing regressor, combining ideas to create a flexible data-efficient tool. The model is continuously updated with two daily samples, a marked reduction compared to conventional batch-based training. This efficiency is guaranteed by a moving window, which prioritizes recent patterns and avoids machine learning drift. A normalization technique recalibrates cumulative sum forecasts by adjusting future targets relative to the latest observed series segment. This narrows the extrapolation range as new data arrives, aligning predictions with the updated training range. Complex architectures are not required when using the approach, as evidenced by an ablation study. The method surpassed algorithms like Time-series Dense Encoder and Neural Basis Expansion Analysis. Promising results were yielded on diverse datasets, including the Volve petroleum field, the UNISIM-II-H synthetic case, and the Open-Power-System-Data. Also, a longitudinal interpretability method is employed. This research aligns with the industry’s real needs, where data is limited and arrives in real-time streams.}
